    App.razor is the entry point into the application and defines the layouts, routing, and behavior for
    top-level interaction with the application.

    Telerik MediaQuery to handle layouts based on screen size. Supporting one layout for table/mobile and
    one layout for desktop. Captures Desktop min-width and renders tablet/mobile view for anything smaller

    It is the responsibility of the individual components to be designed with responsiveness in mind. This layout
    adjustment is purely for the navigation and component container layout adjustments only.

    See: https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/mediaquery/overview for documentation and additional details

    MediaQuery is encapsulated in the DeviceMediaQueryComponent, that provides a subscribable DeviceState that can be accessed
    in any component throughout the entire application.
